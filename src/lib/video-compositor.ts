/**
 * Video Compositor — Format-First Multi-Cut Pipeline
 *
 * CORE PRINCIPLE: A video is NEVER one AI generation call.
 * Every video is a sequence of CUTS — each cut is a separate generation
 * with its own prompt, camera angle, and purpose. Then we stitch.
 *
 * "My whole thesis with AI content is if you're trying to generate it
 *  all in one shot, it looks like crap. But if you splice it together,
 *  then it'll actually look good. It's like 8 AI videos of eight seconds,
 *  but you're only using three seconds from each."
 *
 * The FORMAT determines the cut pattern. A testimonial has different cuts
 * than a market update. The format is the blueprint.
